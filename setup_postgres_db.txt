Setting up a new Network DB on Heroku:

Please install the postgis extension before loading the network data otherwise you won't be able to do so:
 CREATE EXTENSION postgis;
 CREATE EXTENSION postgis_topology;

Next up load the network tables to the database:
 For this you will need the network_to_db.py script, you should be able to find this script on the 
networks bitbucket repository. Once your data is loaded on heroku you can proceed to deploy the app.
